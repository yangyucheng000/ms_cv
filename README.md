# MindSpore Vision Models

## Introduction

**MS_Vision** is an open source repository, which focus on the computer vision models based on MindSpore. MS_Vision is a collection of CV models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders / augmentations, and reference training / validation scripts that aim to pull together a wide variety of SOTA models. All source material is acknowledged via links to github, arxiv papers, etc in the README. Please let me know if I missed anything.

The main branch works with **MindSpore 1.3.0+**.

### Major features

In order to facilitate developers to enjoy the benefits of MindSpore framework, we will continue to add typical networks and some of the related pre-trained models. If you have needs for the model zoo, you can file an issue on the MindSpore project of [gitee](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/issues) or [MindSpore](https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/forum/forum-1076-1.html), We will consider it in time.

- SOTA models using the latest MindSpore APIs

- The best benefits from MindSpore

- Officially maintained and supported
